# 🧩 CSS Layouts & Responsive Web Design Assignment

## 📖 Overview
This project demonstrates how to structure, align, and create flexible web page layouts using **CSS Flexbox** and **CSS Grid**, while applying **Responsive Web Design (RWD)** principles. The layout adapts seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a responsive multi-section webpage with **Grid** and **Flexbox**.
- Use **media queries** and **flexible units** (`%`, `rem`, `vw`, etc.) to adapt layouts.
- Showcase how different screen sizes are handled without breaking the design.
